Start by installing python 3.10.12, then create the virtual environment and install the dependencies by running the following commands in the terminal:
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source ./.venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To exit the environment, simply type `deactivate` in the terminal. You can reenter the environment by running `source ./.venv/bin/activate` again.
